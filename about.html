            <p>Welcome to my digital world! I’m a passionate web designer with a love for creating
                beautiful,user-friendly websites. My journey into web design began with a simple curiosity about how
                websites are built and how they can be used to connect people and ideas.</p>

            <p>With a background in digital media and a keen eye for design, I strive to create websites that not only
                look great but also offer an exceptional user experience. I believe every website should tell a story
                and I’m dedicated to helping my clients share theirs with the world.
            </p>

            <p>I’m currently a student at Northwest Vista College, working toward my Associate of Applied Science in
                Digital Media with a focus on web design. I’ve recently started the
                Bachelor of Applied Technology in Cloud Computing program, and I’m excited to keep learning, creating,
                and exploring new ways to bring websites to life.</p>

            <p>I love turning ideas into beautiful, meaningful websites that reflect both personality and
                purpose.Whether you’re starting a personal brand or growing your business online, I’m here to help bring
                your vision to life with creativity, passion, and a positive mindset.</p>
