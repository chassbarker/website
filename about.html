        <p>
            <strong>Welcome to my digital world!</strong> I’m a passionate web designer with a love for
            <strong>creating beautiful, user-friendly websites.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            With a background in digital media and a sharp eye for design, I focus on creating websites
            that look great. They also offer an exceptional user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every website has a story to tell. I am dedicated to helping my clients share their unique
            stories with the world.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m currently wrapping up an Associate of Applied Science degree in Digital Media. I am
            studying at Northwest Vista College, with a focus on web design. I'm
            expected to graduate in August 2025!
        </p>
        <p>
            I’ve also recently started the Bachelor of Applied Technology in Cloud Computing at
            Northwest Vista College. This program focuses on leveraging internet-based computing
            resources to store, manage, and process data, helping me to keep expanding my skills.
        </p>

        <p>
            Designing with creativity, intention, and heart is what inspires me. Whether you’re
            building a personal brand or expanding your business online, I’m here to help bring your vision to
            life with passion, positive mindset, and a website that stands out.
