        <p>
            As a web design student, I'm passionate about transforming ideas into clean, user-centered digital
            experiences. In
            August, I will graduate with an Associate of Applied Science in Digital Media degree with a focus on web
            design. Having
            earned a Web Design Certificate from Northwest Vista College, I am now working toward a Bachelor of Applied
            Technology
            in Cloud Computing. This course of study has provided a comprehensive understanding of Adobe XD, Bootstrap,
            CSS, Figma,
            GitHub, HTML, JavaScript, SASS, Visual Studio Code, and WordPress.
        </p>

        <p>
            Creativity, dependability, and a thirst for knowledge are among my strongest assets. People often say I have
            a positive
            attitude and a welcoming presence, which helps me connect with others, especially in team settings. My
            objective is to
            secure a web design internship. This is an opportunity to use my skills to build functional and visually
            engaging
            projects that make a real-world difference.
        </p>



        <p>Every website has a story to tell, and my mission is to help clients share their unique stories with the
            world.</p>
