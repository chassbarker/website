        <p>
            Hi, I’m Chassidy Barker! I am a web design student. I love turning ideas into clean, user-focused digital
            experiences. I
            recently earned my Web Design Certificate from Northwest Vista College and am currently pursuing degrees in
            Digital
            Media and Cloud Computing. I have hands-on experience with Adobe XD, Bootstrap, CSS, Figma, GitHub, HTML,
            JavaScript, SASS, Visual Studio Code, and WordPress.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m currently wrapping up my Associate of Applied Science in Digital Media, with a focus on web design, and
            expect to
            graduate in August 2025. I’ve also started the Bachelor of Applied Technology in Cloud Computing at
            Northwest Vista
            College. This program is helping me build a deeper understanding of how to use internet-based resources to
            store,
            manage, and process data — expanding both my creative and technical skills.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am creative, dependable, and always eager to learn. People often say I have a positive attitude and a
            welcoming presence, which helps me connect easily with others and thrive in team settings. I’m currently
            looking for a
            web design internship where I can grow my skills, contribute to real-world projects, and continue creating
            work that’s
            not only functional but also visually engaging.
        </p>

        <p>Every website has a story to tell, and my mission is to help clients share their unique stories with the
            world.</p>
